                                        In Hinduism, the Kumbh Mela, also known as Kumbh Ka Mela,
                                        is a religious festival celebrated four times in 12 years.
                                        The place of worship revolves around the four holy places on the four
                                        holy rivers—at Haridwar on the Ganges River, at Prayag (Allahabad) at the
                                        convergence of the Ganges, the Jamuna, and the Saraswati, at Ujjain on the
                                        Shipra River, and Nashik on the Godavari River. The observance of each site
                                        relies on a separate set of astrological positions of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter,
                                        the most consecrated time when these positions are in complete sync. The Kumbh Mela
                                        in Prayag attracts millions of pilgrims in particular. Also, a great Kumbh Mela is
                                        held in Prayag every 144 years, most recently in 2001. One of the largest festivals
                                        in the world, "The Kumbh Mela," lasts a few weeks which attracts more than 200
                                        million people from all over the world.<br>
                                        According to Hindu mythology, Kumbh Mela is the most significant
                                        religious festival of Hindus celebrated four times across 12 years.
                                        The festival's location revolves around the four pilgrimage sites located
                                        on the banks of the holy river. Earlier in 2003-04, Kumbh Mela was
                                        held at Nashik-Trimbakeshwar.

                                        The Kumbh Mela has its religious significance, which is held every 12 years.
                                        Undoubtedly it is the largest gathering of faith where people from all over
                                        the world take part and bathe in the holy or holy river. The phrase Kumbh
                                        Mela consists of two words Kumbh and Mela, but it is also the Hindi name
                                        for the sign of Aquarius. The name 'Kumbh' is derived from the immortal pot
                                        of nectar with which the gods and demons fought, described in the Puranas
                                        (ancient Vedic scriptures). As we all know, Mela is a Sanskrit word meaning
                                        'gathering' or 'meeting.'<br>
                                        The ancient history of Kumbh Mela relates to the days
                                        when gods and demons unitedly made the nectar of immortality
                                        as delineated by hearsay. The gods and demons acceded to
                                        getting the job done together and decided to share half
                                        of the nectar of immortality each. The Gods and demons
                                        then meet on the shores of the Milky Way, located in the
                                        cosmic realm. The agitation of the sea of milk made a lethal
                                        poison that Lord Shiva drank without being affected.
                                        After overcoming many obstacles, Dhanvantari appeared many
                                        years later with the nectar of immortality. It is perfectly
                                        said that Kumbh Mela is the largest religious and cultural
                                        human gathering in the world. For 48 days, millions of
                                        pilgrims bathed in the holy river. Devotees from all over
                                        the world mainly take part in this mela like sadhus,
                                        sadhvis, ascetics, pilgrims, etc.
