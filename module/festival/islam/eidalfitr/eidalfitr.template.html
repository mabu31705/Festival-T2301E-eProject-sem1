                        As per Eid ul fitr definition, it means the 'Feast of Breaking the Fast'.
                        Eid ul Fitr is the first of the two official holidays in Islam. Falling on the
                        first day of the Islamic calendar's month of Shawwal, Eid ul Fitr is a festival
                        organized with massive feasts all around the world to celebrate the gifts and blessings of Allah.<br>
                        Eid ul Fitr symbolizes virtues like patience, piety, godliness and fortitude.
                        It is a day of celebration as those who observe the fast during Ramadan
                        receive the rewards of rigorous spiritual discipline and month-long worship.
                        On this holy day, Muslims also show their gratitude to Allah for opening
                        the doors of forgiveness and mercy through the sacred month of Ramadan.<br>
                        In addition to being a time for reflection, fresh beginnings and rejoicing
                        with loved ones, Eid ul Fitr is also a reminder to be kind to those who
                        are less fortunate. The day reminds Muslims to embrace people from social
                        and economic circles and share the joy of festivities with the underprivileged,
                        the poor and the neglected. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself used to make
                        sure that all the needy, the downtrodden and widows were able to share
                        the joys of Eid ul Fitr. The day is when all Muslims should count
                        their blessings and help those who are in need of it.
