                                        the poor and the neglected. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself used to make
                                        sure that all the needy, the downtrodden and widows were able to share
                                        the joys of Eid ul Fitr. The day is when all Muslims should count
                                        their blessings and help those who are in need of it.
