                        Eid ul-Adha ('Festival of Sacrifice') is one of the most important festivals
                        in the Muslim calendar. The festival remembers the prophet Ibrahim's willingness
                        to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to.

                        In the holy Quran, Ibrahim dreams that Allah commands him to
                        sacrifice his son Ismail in a sign of obedience to God.<br>
                        Shaytaan (Satan) tried to confuse Ibrahim and tempt him not
                        to go ahead with the sacrifice, but Ibrahim resists the temptation and drives him away.<br>
                        Ibrahim later tries to kill his son, but Allah stops him,
                        sending the Angel Jibreel (Angel Gabriel) with a ram for him to sacrifice instead.<br>
                        "Adha," the Arabic word for "sacrifice," is commemorated on the final
                        day of the Hajj pilgrimage, the fifth pillar of Islam. Muslims who are physically
                        and financially able to go on Hajj are encouraged to do so,
                        in what is seen as an Islamic lifetime duty.<br>
                        The festival is also referred to as Eid al-Kabir (greater Eid, in Arabic),
                        Qurbani Eid (Eid of sacrifice)/Baqra Eid (Eid of "cattle" slaughter,
                        in South Asian languages) and Büyük Bayram (greater Eid, in Turkish).<br>
                        Dr. Fozia Bora, associate professor of Islamic History at the University
                        of Leeds in the U.K., told Newsweek: "The Eid al-Adha festival offers a
                        fascinating case study of how contemporary Muslims grapple with such
                        issues as the ethics of meat consumption in an age of intensive
                        farming and often poor standards of animal welfare.<br>
                        "While vegetarian and vegan Muslims interpret and apply
                        the idea of 'sacrifice' in often quite different ways,
                        the commitment to mark the ancient origins of the festival
                        is retained, as is the desire to help feed the poor and needy.
                        The spirit of giving, sharing and spreading joy, thus blurring
                        distinctions of class and wealth, remains the visible hallmark
                        of the festival across various communities."

                        On Eid al-Adha, Muslims thank Allah for all their blessings
                        and send good wishes to their loved ones.<br>
                        The celebration also typically includes the symbolic sacrifice of a lamb,
                        goat, cow, camel or other animal that is divided into threes to be
                        shared among friends, family and the needy.<br>
                        The sacrificing of animals was also a cultural practice of pre-Islamic
                        Arabs in the Arabian peninsula, Bora said, adding that early Muslims of the
                        region adopted and adapted the practice, which has remained stable over many centuries.<br>
                        Muslims typically attend mosque on the first day of al-Adha,
                        to perform ṣalāt, communal prayer, at dawn. They also donate to charities
                        and visit family and friends, exchanging gifts. The "Qurbani"—or
                        "sacrifice"—is offered in devotion to Allah and to help the vulnerable.<br>
                        "It's remarkable how this festival offers a window onto a multicultural
                        history spanning Biblical narratives, Arabian social practices and
                        modern Muslim interpretations of the idea of 'sacrifice,'" she said.<br>
                        "What we also see is a model of 'unity within diversity' where Muslims
                        from different parts of the world, speaking vastly different languages,
                        living in different climates and with differing local customs, tend to
                        honor the festival in similar ways, through charity, prayers, eating
                        together and decorating homes and bodies."
