                        <p class="text-secondary">We believes in using culture to promote peace, because "countries and
                            cultures often divided by politics can easily and frequently unite over the arts,
                            humanitarianism and health."[2] Based on this belief, We works to promote cultural diversity
                            around the world and create an open platform for intercultural exchange and
                            collaboration.[3] We "â€¦dreams of a global community where cultural diversity is truly
                            fostered and appreciated by all everywhere."[4]</p>

                            <p class="text-secondary">A festival is an extraordinary event celebrated by a community and
                                centering on some characteristic aspect or aspects of that community and its religion or
                                cultures. It is often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival
                                constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high culture-low culture
                                interrelationship.[1] Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is
                                agricultural. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with
                                harvest time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in
                                events that take place in autumn, such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and
                                Easter in the southern.</p>
                            <p class="text-secondary">Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes,
                                especially in regard to commemoration or thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they
                                are called patronal festivals. They may also provide entertainment, which was
                                particularly important to local communities before the advent of mass-produced
                                entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also seek to inform
                                community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing stories and
                                experience provides a means for unity among families.[2] Attendants of festivals are
                                often motivated by a desire for escapism, socialization and camaraderie; the practice
                                has been seen as a means of creating geographical connection, belonging and
                                adaptability.[3][4]</p>
                            <p class="text-secondary">The word "festival" was originally used as an adjective from the
                                late fourteenth century, deriving from Latin via Old French.[5] In Middle English, a
                                "festival dai" was a religious holiday.[6] Its first recorded used as a noun was in 1589
                                (as "Festifall").[5] Feast first came into usage as a noun circa 1200,[7] and its first
                                recorded use as a verb was circa 1300.[8]</p>
                            <p class="text-secondary">The word gala comes from Arabic word khil'a, meaning robe of
                                honor.[9] The word gala was initially used to describe "festive dress", but came to be a
                                synonym of "festival" starting in the 18th century.[10]</p>
