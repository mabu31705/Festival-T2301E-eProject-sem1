     "description": "Christians (/ˈkrɪstʃən, -tiən/ (listen)) are people who follow or adhere to Christianity, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The words Christ and Christian derive from the Koine Greek title Christós (Χριστός), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach (מָשִׁיחַ) (usually rendered as messiah in English).[11] While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict,[12][13] they are united in believing that Jesus has a unique significance.[12] The term Christian used as an adjective is descriptive of anything associated with Christianity or Christian churches, or in a proverbial sense \"all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like.\"[14] It does not have a meaning of 'of Christ' or 'related or pertaining to Christ'.",

     "description": "The Greek word Χριστιανός (Christianos), meaning \"follower of Christ\", comes from Χριστός (Christos), meaning \"anointed one\",[18] with an adjectival ending borrowed from Latin to denote adhering to, or even belonging to, as in slave ownership.[19] In the Greek Septuagint, christos was used to translate the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ (Mašíaḥ, messiah), meaning \"[one who is] anointed\".[20] In other European languages, equivalent words to Christian are likewise derived from the Greek, such as Chrétien in French and Cristiano in Spanish.",

     "description":"The first recorded use of the term (or its cognates in other languages) is in the New Testament, in Acts 11 after Barnabas brought Saul (Paul) to Antioch where they taught the disciples for about a year, the text says that \"the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch\" (Acts 11:26). The second mention of the term follows in Acts 26, where Herod Agrippa II replied to Paul the Apostle, \"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\" (Acts 26:28). The third and final New Testament reference to the term is in 1 Peter 4, which exhorts believers: \"Yet if [any man suffer] as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.\" (1 Peter 4:16).",

     "description": "The word Hindū is derived from Indo-Aryan[43]/Sanskrit[44] root Sindhu,[44][45] believed to be the name of the Indus River in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.[46][44][note 11]\n\nThe Proto-Iranian sound change *s > h occurred between 850 and 600 BCE, according to Asko Parpola.[47] According to Gavin Flood, \"The actual term Hindu first occurs as a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu)\",[44] more specifically in the 6th-century BCE inscription of Darius I (550–486 BCE).[48] The term Hindu in these ancient records is a geographical term and did not refer to a religion.[44] Thapar states that the word Hindu is found as heptahindu in Avesta – equivalent to Rigvedic sapta sindhu, while hndstn (pronounced Hindustan) is found in a Sasanian inscription from the 3rd century CE, both of which refer to parts of northwestern South Asia.[49] In Arabic texts, al-Hind referred to the land beyond the Indus[50] and therefore, all the people in that land were Hindus.[51] This Arabic term was itself taken from the pre-Islamic Persian term Hindū. By the 13th century, Hindustan emerged as a popular alternative name of India, meaning the \"land of Hindus\".[52]",

     "description": "Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.[65][66][67] According to Doniger, \"ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle – vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste – are subjects of debate, not dogma.\"[62]\n\nBecause of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult.[44] The religion \"defies our desire to define and categorize it\".[68] Hinduism has been variously defined as a religion, a religious tradition, a set of religious beliefs, and \"a way of life\".[69][note 1] From a Western lexical standpoint, Hinduism like other faiths is appropriately referred to as a religion. In India, the term dharma is preferred, which is broader than the Western term religion.[70]",

In the Hadith of Gabriel, Islam is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).[47][48]",

     "description": "The central concept of Islam is tawḥīd (Arabic: توحيد), the oneness of God. Usually thought of as a precise monotheism, but also panentheistic in Islamic mystical teachings.[51][52][53][54] God is seen as incomparable and without partners such as in the Christian Trinity, and associating partners to God or attributing God's attributes to others is seen as idolatory, called shirk. God is seen as transcendent of creation and so is beyond comprehension. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules and do not attribute forms to God. God is instead described and referred to by several names or attributes, the most common being Ar-Rahmān (الرحمان) meaning \"The Entirely Merciful,\" and Ar-Rahīm (الرحيم) meaning \"The Especially Merciful\" which are invoked at the beginning of most chapters of the Quran.[55][56]",
