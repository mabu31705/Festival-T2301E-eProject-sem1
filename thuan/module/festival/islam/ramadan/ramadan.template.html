                                        Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.
                                        During the month of Ramadan, Muslims fast between sunrise and sunset,
                                        consuming no food or water during daylight. It's estimated that 1.8 billion
                                        Muslims around the world observe the holy month. Children are not expected
                                        to fast until they reach puberty.

                                        Ramadan is the month of remembrance and celebration of when the Qur'an
                                        (the Muslim holy book) was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel
                                        Gabriel, in A.D. 610. Muslims believe that The Prophet Muhammad is the
                                        last Prophet, who received the teachings of Allah and who spread the Islamic
                                        faith after the Qur'an (believed to be the direct word of Allah) was
                                        revealed to him. It is during the same month of this revelation that
                                        Muslims celebrate Ramadan.<br>
                                        Part of the ancient Arabs' calendars, the word Ramadan is the Arabic
                                        word for 'scorching heat' or 'dryness'.<br>
                                        Since its origin in the 7th century, Ramadan has been a time
                                        for growing the bond with Allah. During Ramadan, Muslims do
                                        this through fasting, reciting the Qur'an and doing selfless
                                        good deeds. By fasting, Muslims are able to devote themselves
                                        to their faith and demonstrate their dedication to Allah.<br>
                                        To celebrate Ramadan, communities will use colourful decorations
                                        and Fanoos (lanterns) to decorate and illuminate buildings and their homes.<br>

                                        Throughout the history of Ramadan, fasting between sunrise and sunset
                                        serves the purpose of demonstrating one's devotion to Allah and belief
                                        in the Prophet Muhammad. Ramadan is a time for fasting (sawm), prayer,
                                        reflection and community.<br>
                                        As Ramadan provides a period of reflection and self-improvement,
                                        many Muslims attempt giving up poor habits and will read
                                        the whole of the Qur'an. Alongside this, Ramadan is a time
                                        for family, community and people will spend time with loved
                                        ones and help those in need.<br>
                                        The self-discipline of fasting also reminds those taking part
                                        in Ramadan of the suffering of the poor and less fortunate.
                                        Throughout the history of Ramadan, it has been common
                                        practice to give to the less fortunate and donate to charity
                                        (Zakat) - which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.<br>
                                        Eid ul-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan with a celebration,
                                        the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast. Mosques hold
                                        special services to mark the end of the fasting and
                                        families and friends come together to eat food,
                                        share gifts and give to charity.
