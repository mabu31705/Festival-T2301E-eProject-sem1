                        Eid ul-Adha ('Festival of Sacrifice') is one of the most important festivals
                         in the Muslim calendar. The festival remembers the prophet Ibrahim's willingness
                          to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to.

                        In the holy Quran, Ibrahim dreams that Allah commands him to
                         sacrifice his son Ismail in a sign of obedience to God.<br>
                         Shaytaan (Satan) tried to confuse Ibrahim and tempt him not
                          to go ahead with the sacrifice, but Ibrahim resists the temptation and drives him away.<br>
                          Ibrahim later tries to kill his son, but Allah stops him,
                           sending the Angel Jibreel (Angel Gabriel) with a ram for him to sacrifice instead.<br>
                           "Adha," the Arabic word for "sacrifice," is commemorated on the final
                            day of the Hajj pilgrimage, the fifth pillar of Islam. Muslims who are physically
                             and financially able to go on Hajj are encouraged to do so,
                              in what is seen as an Islamic lifetime duty.<br>
                              The festival is also referred to as Eid al-Kabir (greater Eid, in Arabic),
                               Qurbani Eid (Eid of sacrifice)/Baqra Eid (Eid of "cattle" slaughter,
                                in South Asian languages) and Büyük Bayram (greater Eid, in Turkish).<br>
                                Dr. Fozia Bora, associate professor of Islamic History at the University
                                 of Leeds in the U.K., told Newsweek: "The Eid al-Adha festival offers a
                                  fascinating case study of how contemporary Muslims grapple with such
                                   issues as the ethics of meat consumption in an age of intensive
                                    farming and often poor standards of animal welfare.<br>
                                    "While vegetarian and vegan Muslims interpret and apply
                                     the idea of 'sacrifice' in often quite different ways,
                                      the commitment to mark the ancient origins of the festival
                                       is retained, as is the desire to help feed the poor and needy.
                                        The spirit of giving, sharing and spreading joy, thus blurring
                                         distinctions of class and wealth, remains the visible hallmark
                                          of the festival across various communities."

                        On Eid al-Adha, Muslims thank Allah for all their blessings
                         and send good wishes to their loved ones.<br>
                         The celebration also typically includes the symbolic sacrifice of a lamb,
                          goat, cow, camel or other animal that is divided into threes to be
                           shared among friends, family and the needy.<br>
                           The sacrificing of animals was also a cultural practice of pre-Islamic
                            Arabs in the Arabian peninsula, Bora said, adding that early Muslims of the
                             region adopted and adapted the practice, which has remained stable over many centuries.<br>
                             Muslims typically attend mosque on the first day of al-Adha,
                              to perform ṣalāt, communal prayer, at dawn. They also donate to charities
                               and visit family and friends, exchanging gifts. The "Qurbani"—or
                                "sacrifice"—is offered in devotion to Allah and to help the vulnerable.<br>
                                "It's remarkable how this festival offers a window onto a multicultural
                                 history spanning Biblical narratives, Arabian social practices and
                                  modern Muslim interpretations of the idea of 'sacrifice,'" she said.<br>
                                  "What we also see is a model of 'unity within diversity' where Muslims
                                   from different parts of the world, speaking vastly different languages,
                                    living in different climates and with differing local customs, tend to
                                     honor the festival in similar ways, through charity, prayers, eating
                                      together and decorating homes and bodies."
