                                with loved ones, Eid ul Fitr is also a reminder to be kind to those who
                                 are less fortunate. The day reminds Muslims to embrace people from social
                                  and economic circles and share the joy of festivities with the underprivileged,
                                   the poor and the neglected. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself used to make
                                    sure that all the needy, the downtrodden and widows were able to share
                                     the joys of Eid ul Fitr. The day is when all Muslims should count
                                      their blessings and help those who are in need of it.
