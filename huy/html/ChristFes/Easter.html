                        Easter is a Christian festival which celebrates the resurrection
                         of Jesus Christ. The holiday falls on April 21 this year and will
                          be celebrated all across the globe. According to the New Testament
                           of the Bible, Easter occurs three days after the crucifixion of Jesus
                            by Romans. Easter concludes the “Passion of Christ”, which begins with
                             a 40 days period of fasting - Lent and is concluded by the Holy Week.
                              Holy Thursday (celebration of Jesus's last supper) and the crucifixion of
                               Jesus Christ on Good Friday is a part of the Holy Week which ends on Easter Sunday.

                        The story behind Easter lies in the New Testament of the Bible
                         which narrates how Jesus was arrested by the Roman authorities
                          because he claimed to be the “Son of God”. He was then sentenced
                          to death by Pontius Pilate, the Roman emperor by crucifixion.
                           His resurrection three days later marks the occasion of Easter.
                            This day is also closely associated with the Jewish festival of Passover.

                        Easter is celebrated as a joyous occasion and the Sunday prior is
                         called Palm Sunday which marks the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem.
                          Various churches begin the celebration in the late hours of Saturday
                           through a religious service called Easter Vigil. Non-religious celebrations
                            include the tradition of Easter eggs, which represent fertility and birth
                             and Easter bunny which delivers chocolates and sweets to kids on Sunday morning.

                        Chocolate-filled eggs or brightly painted eggs with sweets inside are
                         common gifts exchanged on Easter. People choose to loosen their purse
                          strings and splurge on the Easter weekend as the celebrations arrive
                           after a 40-day lent period. Some examples of non-religious Easter traditions
                            include a treasure hunt like search for Easter eggs, and games such as egg
                             rolling and egg decorating.

                        Hidden messages or pop-culture references in films,
                         multimedia games and other media are also termed Easter Eggs?
                          That's because Easter eggs mimic the idea of the hunt for an
                           Easter egg during the festival. These could be hidden messages,
                            characters or images. It's like a little secret that the software
                             programmers or directors want to share, yet be discreet about them.
                              It is a fun and engaging activity to look for these Easter eggs because
                               it usually reveals more about the character or the plotline.
