                        The most significant celebration of the year in India is Diwali,
                         which commemorates the victory of light over darkness, wisdom over
                          ignorance, and goodness over evil. The five days of Diwali are celebrated
                           by more than a billion people of different faiths throughout India and its
                            diaspora, and they include prayer, feasts, fireworks, family get-togethers,
                             and philanthropic giving.<br>
                             However, Diwali is most well-known for being a festival of lights.
                              Diwali, which means "row of lights" in Sanskrit, is celebrated by
                               lining up brilliantly glowing clay lamps outside dwellings.
                                The festival's name is derived from this.<br>
                                This festival's dates are determined by the Hindu lunar calendar,
                                 which assigns a month to the length of the moon's orbit around the Earth.
                                  Between the Hindu months of Asvina and Kartika,
                                   which usually fall in October or November on the Gregorian calendar,
                                    is when Diwali begins. The first day of Diwali in 2022 is October 22,
                                     and the most significant celebration day is October 24.

                    <div class="p">There is no one origin narrative for Diwali because it is so widely commemorated,
                         in addition to being a significant religious holiday for Hindus. Although every faith has
                          a different historical explanation for the festival, they all ultimately stand for the
                           triumph of virtue over evil.<br>
                           Hinduism alone is thought to be the world's oldest living religion,
                            dating back to the second millennium BC. Different geographical regions
                             have different interpretations of the Diwali story. These, however,
                              are all epic stories of men who, according to Hindu belief,
                               were manifestations of the god Vishnu, who is regarded as the universe's
                                sustainer and whose job it is to restore the balance between good and evil
                                 in difficult times.<br>
                                 In northern India, Diwali celebrates Prince Rama's triumphant
                                  return to the city of Ayodhya following the dramatic rescue of
                                   his wife Sita, a manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi who had been
                                    abducted by the rival king Ravana, who had been exiled for 14 years
                                     due to the machinations of his evil stepmother.

                        Diwali customs vary from place to region, just like the holiday tales do.
                         But what they all share is an abundance of sweets, family get-togethers,
                          and the lighting of clay lamps, which stand for the inner light that guards
                           each home against spiritual darkness.<br>
                           However, generally speaking, each of the five Diwali days has a unique meaning.
                            People pray to the goddess Lakshmi on the first day of Diwali, bake sweets,
                             and clean their homes. The following day, they decorate their homes with
                              lamps and rangolis, which are patterns constructed on the floor out of
                               coloured sand, powder, rice, or flower petals.
